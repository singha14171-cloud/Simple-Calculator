# 🧮 College Calculator (Python CLI)

A simple command-line based calculator built using Python.
This program performs basic arithmetic operations — Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division — based on user input.


---

## 🚀 Features

* User-friendly command-line interface
* Supports the four basic operations:

  * ➕ Addition
  * ➖ Subtraction
  * ✖️ Multiplication
  * ➗ Division
* Handles invalid operator input
* Beginner-friendly Python code

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. The program asks the user to enter:

   * First number
   * Second number
   * Operator (+, -, *, /)

2. Based on the chosen operator, it performs the calculation:

| Operator | Operation      |
| -------- | -------------- |
| `+`      | Addition       |
| `-`      | Subtraction    |
| `*`      | Multiplication |
| `/`      | Division       |

3. If an invalid operator is entered, the program prints:

   ```
   invalid choice
   ```
